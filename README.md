# Forum Guidelines Text Box

This is a small JavaScript, CSS and HTML project deployed to the OVO Forum site: https://forum.ovoenergy.com/topic/new

## What is this project?

The text box reminds users to search for existing topics and read the community rules before posting a new topic. It also provides guidance on when to contact customer support and reminds users to be respectful to other members.

This has been added to our site as custom code, with the majority of the content, styles and scripts of the site being built by the content management system (CMS), managed by Insided: https://www.insided.com/ 

## What are the features of this project?

The HTML in this project includes links to relevant resources to help and guide the user on the best next steps.

The CSS applied aims to match the styles of this site, and other widgets on it. 

The text box has javascript applied so that it only appears when the user is on the 'create a topic' page. This is done by adding a 'display: none' style when the URL does not include 'topic/new'.
